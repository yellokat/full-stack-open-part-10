# Differences from the course material

1. Due to some outdated packages, I decided to use Expo SDK version 52 in this project. 
2. Due to the Expo SDK update, I had to migrate to a newer version of eslint, with completely different configuration syntax. However the configurations are still identical to those presented in the course material.
